            <h2>Creating single Vue components in WordPress theme without bundler</h2>

            <p>The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to add single Vue elements to a WordPress theme. You don't need to use any bundler or to install NPM packages. Installing Vue using NPM is recommended for building larger Vue applications. 
            In such cases, a build tool must be installed along with the NPM packages to handle the application's bundling.

            <p>For smaller dynamic features, Vue.js can be added to a WordPress theme using a <b>CDN</b> installation. In this approach, Vue components are added to JavaScript <b><i>.js</i></b> files instead of <b><i>.vue</i></b> files. 
            To manage Vue components, a <b><i>js</i></b> directory is created within the WordPress theme to store JavaScript files containing Vue code. It is advisable to organize the JavaScript files based on the functionalities being implemented. 
            For example, if the page includes three different features, such as a slider, a dropdown menu, and dynamic tabs, the <b><i>js</i></b> folder should contain three separate JavaScript files.</p>

            <h2>Adding necessary scripts</h2>

            <p>JavaScript scripts are added to WordPress using the wp_enqueue_script() function, which includes the CDN link in the functions.php file. Each JavaScript file must be linked to the WordPress theme through this function. 
                When adding JavaScript files, the value true should be passed as the last argument in the wp_enqueue_script() function. 
            This places the JavaScript file in the footer, ensuring that Vue functionalities are executed only after the DOM tree has fully loaded.</p>
